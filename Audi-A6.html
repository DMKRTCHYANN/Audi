        <h3>What makes the Audi A6 Sportback e-tron the most aerodynamic Audi ever?</h3>
        <p>Audi A6 Sportback e-tron performance: Combined electric power consumption in kWh/100 km (62.1 mi): 15.9-14.0; combined CO2 emissions in g/km (g/mi): 0 (0) CO2-class.</p>

            <p>Intensive work in the wind tunnel: (From left to right) Aerodynamics developer Matteo Ghelfi, wheel designer Andreas Valencia Pollex, and aerodynamics developer Andreas Lauterbach achieved an exceptionally low drag coefficient for the Audi A6 e-tron.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 60px;"><b>With an exceptionally low Cd value of 0.21, the Audi A6 Sportback e-tron1 achieves the 
            best value an Audi production vehicle has ever registered. How has this been accomplished? 
            Moni Islam, Head of Aerodynamics/Aeroacoustics Development, provides answers in the Audi
            wind tunnel.
        </b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px"> 
                The tube, where wind speeds up to 300 km/h are possible, is 47 meters long. The wind 
                tunnel at Audi in Ingolstadt has an enormous capacity, while the operating noise is 
                extremely low. "When the tunnel is empty, and we ramp up the wind, you can't hear anything,"
                says Moni Islam, Head of Aerodynamics/Aeroacoustics Development at Audi, and explains: "The
                tunnel has to be this quiet that we can hear the wind noise on the vehicle. This is the
                only way we can reduce it to a minimum." Islam should know. The wind tunnel is like a
                second living room for him. To develop the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of the Audi
                 A6 Sportback e-tron1, his team invested almost 1,000 hours. After around 3,000 
                 accompanying computer simulations, one thing is certain: the A6 Sportback e-tron1 is 
                 the best Audi ever in terms of aerodynamics.

        <h2>The special role of aerodynamics in electric mobility</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">The exceptionally low drag coefficient of 0.21 propels the A6 Sportback e-tron1 to the top
            of all production vehicles in the entire Volkswagen Group. The so-called Cd value serves 
            as a measure of how streamlined an object is. The A6 Avant e-tron2 is also one of the best
            in its body segment, achieving a drag coefficient of 0.24. Aerodynamics play a vital role 
            in electromobility: among other things, they determine energy efficiency, which is considered
            the key to the success of electric vehicles. "Our customers expect a long range, so the
            vehicles have to be efficient. That is why aerodynamics are important," says Islam. 
            "In the coming years, energy efficiency will become a dominant topic in our society."

            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
                The aerodynamics experts also draw inspiration for the perfect silhouette 
                from nature. According to Islam, the example of the teardrop shape is somewhat
                worn out, but the penguin is even more interesting. "The penguin has a very 
                low Cd value; in the literature, you can find values between 0.06 and 0.09." 
                However, there are limits to car design. "As long as a car has to be aesthetically 
                pleasing and suitable for everyday use, there will be a limit that we can't go below.
                We are very close to that with the A6 e-tron3." The A6 Sportback e-tron1 achieves 
                ranges of up to 756 kilometers on a single charge thanks to its outstanding aerodynamics,
                among other things.

          <h1>Meticulous attention to detail</h1>
          <p style="margin-top: 30px;">The basic rule for the lowest possible air resistance: "As round as possible up to 
            the rear and as few edges as possible," says Islam. But there is more to it than that;
            meticulous detail work is required. "I always compare the development of a vehicle’s
            aerodynamics to a marathon race that lasts four to five years - there are highs and lows." 
            Aerodynamics engineers Andreas Lauterbach and Matteo Ghelfi have now crossed the finish
            line with their team.

        Moni Islam and his team worked meticulously on the details: the headlights 
        on the Audi A6 e-tron are almost flush with the outer skin.

          <h1>The aerodynamic refinements of the A6 Sportback e-tron</h1>
          <p>
            A unique feature of the new A6 Sportback e-tron is its flat silhouette with a roof that gradually slopes down towards the rear.
            "This shape is ultimately the prerequisite for the outstanding Cd value," explains Islam. Then there are the many small details,
            such as a controllable cooling air intake, located behind a decorative grille under the Singleframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Islam: "This allows us to control exactly how much air flows through and around the vehicle. The less airflow there is, the better."
            Another refinement is the headlights, which are almost flush with the outer skin. "We have optimized this area so the air flows optimally
            around the headlights and fenders. A little further down, there is a small opening in the bodywork: to avoid flow losses, the so-called
            'air curtain' directs the air from the front around the corner."

        <h1>Aerodynamics: thought through from the first brushstroke</h1>
        <p>
            To achieve their goal, the aerodynamics experts are involved from 
            the first brushstroke of the design team. "We discuss and help shape 
            the vehicle and support it in terms of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics 
            until it goes into series production," says Islam. Time and again, tests
            are carried out in the wind tunnel, where professional skiers occasionally 
            train too, perfecting their posture in flight or on the descent.

             <h1>"No contradiction between design and aerodynamics"</h1>
             <p>
                There must be no compromises on design, one of the premium
                features of the four rings. "We will continue to offer our 
                customers long range without packing cars with huge batteries," 
                says Islam. "The Audi A6 e-tron3 is another example of the fact
                that there is no contradiction between good design and good 
                aerodynamics."
